## Collaboration 
For now, we will work seperately. Since we are only two members in this group, each person will be responsible for a part of the homework. For the week2 homework, Thomas will do part 2A, and Marco will do part 2B. 

The branch structure is set up such that each of us works in our own personal branch until it is ready to be merged into the main branch via a pull request.
